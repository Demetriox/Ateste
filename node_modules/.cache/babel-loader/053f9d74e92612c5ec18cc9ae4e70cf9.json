Specifically the server splits paths into segments first and then\n * sorts, putting end-of-segment before any character. In a UTF-8 string\n * encoding the slash ('/') that denotes the end-of-segment naturally comes\n * after other characters so the intent here is to encode the path delimiters in\n * such a way that the resulting strings sort naturally.\n *\n * Resource paths are also used for prefix scans so it's important to\n * distinguish whole segments from any longer segments of which they might be a\n * prefix. For example, it's important to make it possible to scan documents in\n * a collection \"foo\" without encountering documents in a collection \"foobar\".\n *\n * Separate from the concerns about resource path ordering and separation,\n * On Android, SQLite imposes additional restrictions since it does not handle\n * keys with embedded NUL bytes particularly well. Rather than change the\n * implementation we keep the encoding identical to keep the ports similar.\n *\n * Taken together this means resource paths when encoded for storage in\n * IndexedDB have the following characteristics:\n *\n *   * Segment separators (\"/\") sort before everything else.\n *   * All paths have a trailing separator.\n *   * NUL bytes do not exist in the output, since IndexedDB doesn't treat them\n * well.\n *\n * Therefore resource paths are encoded into string form using the following\n * rules:\n *\n *   * '\\x01' is used as an escape character.\n *   * Path separators are encoded as \"\\x01\\x01\"\n *   * NUL bytes are encoded as \"\\x01\\x10\"\n *   * '\\x01' is encoded as \"\\x01\\x11\"\n *\n * This encoding leaves some room between path separators and the NUL byte\n * just in case we decide to support integer document ids after all.\n *\n * Note that characters treated specially by the backend ('.', '/', and '~')\n * are not treated specially here.

Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nexport class IndexedDbPersistence implements Persistence {\n  static getStore<Key extends IDBValidKey, Value>(\n    txn: PersistenceTransaction,\n    store: string\n  ): SimpleDbStore<Key, Value> {\n    if (txn instanceof IndexedDbTransaction) {\n      return SimpleDb.getStore<Key, Value>(txn.simpleDbTransaction, store);\n    } else {\n      throw fail(\n        'IndexedDbPersistence must use instances of IndexedDbTransaction'\n      );\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * The name of the main (and currently only) IndexedDB database. this name is\n   * appended to the prefix provided to the IndexedDbPersistence constructor.\n   */\n  static MAIN_DATABASE = 'main';\n\n  // Technically `simpleDb` should be `| undefined` because it is\n  // initialized asynchronously by start(), but that would be more misleading\n  // than useful.\n  private simpleDb!: SimpleDb;\n\n  private listenSequence: ListenSequence | null = null;\n\n  private _started = false;\n  private isPrimary = false;\n  private networkEnabled = true;\n  private dbName: string;\n\n  /** Our window.unload handler, if registered. */\n  private windowUnloadHandler: (() => void) | null = null;\n  private inForeground = false;\n\n  private serializer: LocalSerializer;\n\n  /** Our 'visibilitychange' listener if registered. */\n  private documentVisibilityHandler: ((e?: Event) => void) | null = null;\n\n  /** The client metadata refresh task. */\n  private clientMetadataRefresher: DelayedOperation<void> | null = null;\n\n  /** The last time we garbage collected the client metadata object store. */\n  private lastGarbageCollectionTime = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;\n\n  /** A listener to notify on primary state changes. */\n  private primaryStateListener: PrimaryStateListener = _ => Promise.resolve();\n\n  private readonly targetCache: IndexedDbTargetCache;\n  private readonly indexManager: IndexedDbIndexManager;\n  private readonly remoteDocumentCache: IndexedDbRemoteDocumentCache;\n  private readonly webStorage: Storage | null;\n  readonly referenceDelegate: IndexedDbLruDelegate;\n\n  constructor(\n    /**\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n     * access to local persistence.\n     */\n    private readonly allowTabSynchronization: boolean,\n\n    private readonly persistenceKey: string,\n    private readonly clientId: ClientId,\n    lruParams: LruParams,\n    private readonly queue: AsyncQueue,\n    private readonly window: WindowLike | null,\n    private readonly document: DocumentLike | null,\n    serializer: JsonProtoSerializer,\n    private readonly sequenceNumberSyncer: SequenceNumberSyncer,\n\n    /**\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.
